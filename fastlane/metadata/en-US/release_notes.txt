We re-enabled 1Password support that unfortunately had to be disabled in a previous release. We missed it too!

We added landscape and multitasking support for iPADs! Almost all of our negative reviews were about this issue, so let us know what you think!

We yanked the comment reply tool outside of the little hidden menu near each comment, making replies much easier. Enjoy!

We broke GIF uploading in the last release, but fixed it up for you in this one! Sorry about that. Commence animating all the things!

We fixed a bug with the editing of long text posts. We love you @ellowrites community!
