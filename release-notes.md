#### #60 - Omnibar!
I tried to break this up into more branches, but the git history is kind of a mess, so oh well.

- TabBarItems, the selectedImage was not working, got that back in. (b3fa5e4)
- Functional specs and features (added `Functional.timer`) (2fe504a)
- Added specs for TypedNotifications, and added `removeObservers()` (064c8e7)
  The OmnibarViewController reuses the observer, so relying on `deinit` didn't feel reliable.
- Amazon services, this is broken up into a few parts: (ee607ab)
    - S3UploadingService
    - ElloS3
    - AmazonCredentials
    - MultipartRequestBuilder
- Added `toJSON` to `TextRegion,ImageRegion`, so that those can be sent to the `CreatePost` endpoint (ee2306d)
- `Keyboard` is a global object that monitors the keyboard state, and stores the height and animation properties (81e45c6)
