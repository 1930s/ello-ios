## Ello iOS App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ello/ello-ios.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ello/ello-ios)

### Environment Variables

We use the `dotenv` gem to access application secrets in the terminal, and `cocoapods-keys` to store them in the app.


- `ELLO_STAFF`: set this in your bash/zsh startup script to access private cocoapods.
- `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`: used for generating release notes during distribution
- `INVITE_FRIENDS_SALT`: used for generating the salt for sending emails to the API.
- STAGING/PROD environment specific:
  - `#{ENV}_CLIENT_KEY`: the key or id used for oauth (e.g. `STAGING_CLIENT_KEY`)
  - `#{ENV}_CLIENT_SECRET`: the secret used for oauth (e.g. `PROD_CLIENT_SECRET`)
  - `#{ENV}_DOMAIN`: the domain for the API to hit
  - `#{ENV}_HTTP_PROTOCOL`: the protocol for the API to hit (http or https, useful when running a local instance of the API)

If you would like to run the iOS app, please [contact us](mailto:ios@ello.co) for client credentials.


### Setup

Once you have staging and production client credentials, you can switch between them by running:

- Prod: `bundle exec rake generate:prod_keys`
- Staging: `bundle exec rake generate:staging_keys`


### Other

- List available rake tasks: `bundle exec rake -T`


### Testing out Push Notifications with APNS Pusher

- Download apns pusher https://github.com/KnuffApp/Knuff/releases
- Install `ElloDevPushSandbox.p12` in your keychain (talk to [@steam](https://github.com/steam) to get it)
- Print out your device's APNS Token in the function `updateToken()` in `PushNotificationController`
- Build to device in `Debug` mode
- Code Signing Identity: `iPhone Distribution: Ello PBC (ABC12345)`
- Provisioning Profile `iOSTeam Provisioning Profile: co.ello.ElloDev`


### Universal Links

Starting with iOS 9 Apple added support for [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html). The previous link does a good job explaining the concept. Generating the `apple-app-site-association` file that is needed on the server is not well explained.

`aasa.json`

```json
{
    "applinks": {
        "apps": [],
        "details": [
            {
                "appID": "ABC12345.co.ello.ElloDev",
                "paths": [ "*" ]
            },
            {
                "appID": "ABC12345.co.ello.ElloStage",
                "paths": [ "*" ]
            },
            {
                "appID": "ABC12345.co.ello.Ello",
                "paths": [ "/native_redirect/*" ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

`STAR_ello_co.key`, `STAR_ello_co.crt` and `STAR_ello_co.pem` are in the Ello Ops 1Password vault

```bash
cat aasa.json | openssl smime \
 -sign \
 -inkey STAR_ello_co.key \
 -signer STAR_ello_co.crt \
 -certfile STAR_ello_co.pem \
 -noattr \
 -nodetach \
 -outform DER > apple-app-site-association
```

### Pinning certificates

We use pinned certificates to avoid man-in-the-middle SSL attacks.  We use a rolling "primary + backup" pair of certificates, so if the primary expires or needs to be pulled, the backup is easy to swap in.  Every now and then the primary / backup need to be rotated.

When new `.pem`/certificates are installed on ello.co and ello.ninja, we need to create and install a pinned certificate `.cer` file in the iOS app.  Get the `.pem` files from DevOps / Jay, and convert it using something like this:

```bash
openssl x509 -inform PEM -in ~/Downloads/ello_ninja_cert.pem -outform DER -out Resources/SSL/STAR_ello_ninja_3_2_2016.cer
openssl x509 -inform PEM -in ~/Downloads/ello_co_cert.pem -outform DER -out Resources/SSL/STAR_ello_co_3_2_2016.cer
```

`3_2_2016` is the expiration date of the new certs.

Add it to Xcode and you're ready!  To test the new cert:

1. In `ElloManager.swift`, make sure `ello.ninja` is associated with `ServerTrustPolicy.publicKeysInBundle()`
2. Compile the iOS app, pointing it at `ello.ninja`
3. You can make this fail by *excluding* the cert that is used for `ello.ninja`

To test the production cert

1. Add the new cert to `ssl.ello.co`
2. Compile the iOS app, pointing it at (staging) `ssl.ello.co`
3. Make it fail again by excluding the new `ello.co` cert
